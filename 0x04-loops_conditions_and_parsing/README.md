This project is about Loops, conditions and persing in __Shell__.

## General
in this particular project, we were able to:
* create SSH keys.
* use `while`, `until` and `for` loops.
* use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements.
* use the `cut` command.

## tasks
In this project, differents tasks were achieved:
0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
	* we were able to create a RSA key pair.

1. For Best School loop
	* Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times, using a `for` loop.

2. While Best School loop
	* Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times, using `while` loop.

3. Until Best School loop
	* Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times, using `until` loop.

4. If 9, say Hi!
	* Write a Bash script that displays `Best School` 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, displays `Best School` and then `Hi` on a new line.

5. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance
	* Write a Bash script that loops from 1 to 10 and:
		* displays bad luck for the 4th loop iteration.
		* displays good luck for the 8th loop iteration.
		* displays Best School for the other iterations.

6. Superstitious numbers
	* Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and:
		* displays `4` and then `bad luck from China` for the 4th loop iteration
		* displays `9` and then `bad luck from Japan` for the 9th loop iteration
		* displays `17` and then `bad luck from Italy` for the 17th loop iteration

7. Clock
	* Write a Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes:
		* display hours from `0` to `12`
